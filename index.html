      <h1>About Dave</h1>
      <h2>Museums and a great cat.</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of this web page, I will discuss two important topics:
          How much I like museums, and how I have a totally awesome cat.</p>

      <h1>So Many Museums</h1>
        <p>I've always loved museums and archives and visit new ones whenever I can.

          eleven years.</p>

      <h1>Pickles the Cat</h1>
        <p>The aforementioned great cat is named Pickles, and she's just the best. We got her
          as a stray six years ago in Topeka, Kansas after she'd been super sick
          from a neck infection. She's part ragdoll and part calico. The ragdoll
          portion means that when she's happy or scared she goes completely limp,
          which is both funny and adorable.</p>
